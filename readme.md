# Autonomy â€” a Logseq theme

A simple theme focused on note taking focus over features. This theme is built on very basic css, so if anybody is curious and have the skills to make it better, please do. 

## Install

Until this theme has been made official, I recommend this solution. 

    Add this line to your `custom.css` in Logseq:

    @import url("https://raw.githack.com/larsrose/autonomy-theme/main/theme.css");

## Design tokens
All colors and sizes live at the top of `theme.css`. Customize them first; the rest of the CSS reads those variables.
