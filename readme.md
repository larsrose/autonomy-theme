# Autonomy — a Logseq theme

A calm, human-friendly theme inspired by degrowth. Warm paper surfaces, readable serif headings, maroon accents, and moss-green tags.

## Install (dev)
1. Clone/download this repo.
2. In Logseq: **Settings → Plugins → Load unpacked plugin**, select the folder.
3. Switch to **Settings → Themes → Autonomy (Light)**.

## Design tokens
All colors and sizes live at the top of `theme.css`. Customize them first; the rest of the CSS reads those variables.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Dark theme
- [ ] Callouts/admonitions
- [ ] Query + right-sidebar polish
- [ ] Mobile tweaks
